Installing RKE
RKE is both a Kubernetes distribution and an installer. The installer runs on a local workstation or shared management host, and you use it to provision a cluster over SSH.
You can find the latest version of RKE for your platform on the releases page at github.com/rancher/rke. Binaries exist for macOS, Windows, and Linux on both x86 and Arm.
Installing it is as easy as downloading it, changing the name, moving it into your search path, and making it executable for platforms that require it.
If you're on Mac, you can also install it through Homebrew.
