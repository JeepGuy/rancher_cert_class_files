Introduction
Rancher is a distributed microservice-based application, that runs as a Kubernetes app.

Rancher's design fundamentally embraces the Kubernetes design ethos by building our technology off of design primitives such as:
```
controllers, 
CRDs, 
etcd, 
and other resources.
```

The company is known as Rancher Labs, though it's often referred to simply as Rancher.

The Kubernetes management software is also known as Rancher, 
     but we often refer to it as "Rancher Server" for clarity.
     
Rancher has two Kubernetes distributions - RKE and K3s. 
     RKE stands for "Rancher Kubernetes Engine" and runs upstream Kubernetes entirely in Docker containers.
